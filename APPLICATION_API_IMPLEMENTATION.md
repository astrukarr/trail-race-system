# Application API Endpoints - Implementation Summary

## üìã Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Application API endpoints in the Command Service.

## üöÄ What Was Implemented

### **Application API Endpoints**

- `POST /api/applications` - Create application
- `DELETE /api/applications/:id` - Delete application

## üîß Implementation Details

### **1. POST /api/applications - Create Application**

#### **Features:**

- ‚úÖ **Authorization**: Only Applicant role can create applications
- ‚úÖ **Validation**: Joi schema validation for all fields
- ‚úÖ **Race Existence Check**: Verifies race exists before creating application
- ‚úÖ **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents user from applying for same race twice
- ‚úÖ **Database**: Stores application in PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ **Event Publishing**: Publishes APPLICATION_CREATED event to RabbitMQ
- ‚úÖ **Logging**: Logs all operations with user context

#### **Request Body:**

```json
{
  "firstName": "Test",
  "lastName": "User",
  "club": "Test Club",
  "raceId": "8836353a-0100-4e86-b74a-d7ca19a88866"
}
```

#### **Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "Application created successfully",
  "application": {
    "id": "d952e6e4-800a-4b56-9770-631bf48d53c9",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "club": "Test Club",
    "raceId": "8836353a-0100-4e86-b74a-d7ca19a88866",

    "updatedAt": "2025-09-14T11:25:02.928Z"
  }
}
```

#### **Validation Rules:**

- `firstName`: Required, max 255 characters
- `lastName`: Required, max 255 characters
- `club`: Optional, max 255 characters (can be empty string)
- `raceId`: Required, must be valid UUID

### **2. DELETE /api/applications/:id - Delete Application**

#### **Features:**

- ‚úÖ **Authorization**: Only Applicant role can delete applications
- ‚úÖ **Ownership Check**: Users can only delete their own applications
- ‚úÖ **Existence Check**: Verifies application exists before deleting
- ‚úÖ **Database**: Deletes application from PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ **Event Publishing**: Publishes APPLICATION_DELETED event to RabbitMQ
- ‚úÖ **Logging**: Logs all operations with user context

#### **Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "Application deleted successfully",
  "application": {
    "id": "d952e6e4-800a-4b56-9770-631bf48d53c9",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "club": "Test Club",
    "raceId": "8836353a-0100-4e86-b74a-d7ca19a88866"
  }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Results

### **‚úÖ Successful Tests:**

1. **Create Application as Applicant**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/applications \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer APPLICANT_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"firstName":"Test","lastName":"User","club":"Test Club","raceId":"8836353a-0100-4e86-b74a-d7ca19a88866"}'
   ```

   **Result**: ‚úÖ Application created successfully

2. **Delete Application as Applicant**
   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/applications/APPLICATION_ID \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer APPLICANT_TOKEN"
   ```
   **Result**: ‚úÖ Application deleted successfully

### **‚úÖ Error Handling Tests:**

1. **Race Not Found**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/applications \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer APPLICANT_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"firstName":"Test","lastName":"User","club":"Test Club","raceId":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"}'
   ```

   **Result**: ‚úÖ "Race not found" (404)

2. **Validation Error**

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/applications \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer APPLICANT_TOKEN" \
     -d '{"firstName":"","lastName":"User","club":"Test Club","raceId":"8836353a-0100-4e86-b74a-d7ca19a88866"}'
   ```

   **Result**: ‚úÖ "Validation error" (400)

3. **Duplicate Application Prevention**

   - User tries to apply for same race twice
     **Result**: ‚úÖ "You have already applied for this race" (409)

4. **Application Not Found**
   ```bash
   curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3001/api/applications/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer APPLICANT_TOKEN"
   ```
   **Result**: ‚úÖ "Application not found or you don't have permission to delete it" (404)

## üîÑ Event-Driven Architecture

### **Events Published to RabbitMQ:**

#### **1. APPLICATION_CREATED Event**

```json
{
  "type": "APPLICATION_CREATED",
  "payload": {
    "id": "d952e6e4-800a-4b56-9770-631bf48d53c9",
    "userId": "90de7bc0-88bd-46de-bfd5-d630b2065f1d",
    "raceId": "8836353a-0100-4e86-b74a-d7ca19a88866",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "club": "Test Club",
    "createdAt": "2025-09-14T11:25:02.928Z",
    "updatedAt": "2025-09-14T11:25:02.928Z"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-09-14T11:25:02.928Z",
  "correlationId": "uuid"
}
```

#### **2. APPLICATION_DELETED Event**

```json
{
  "type": "APPLICATION_DELETED",
  "payload": {
    "id": "d952e6e4-800a-4b56-9770-631bf48d53c9",
    "userId": "90de7bc0-88bd-46de-bfd5-d630b2065f1d",
    "raceId": "8836353a-0100-4e86-b74a-d7ca19a88866",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
    "club": "Test Club"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-09-14T11:25:02.928Z",
  "correlationId": "uuid"
}
```

## üìä Database Operations

### **SQL Queries Used:**

#### **Create Application:**

```sql
INSERT INTO applications (id, user_id, race_id, first_name, last_name, club, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, NOW(), NOW()) RETURNING *
```

#### **Delete Application:**

```sql
DELETE FROM applications WHERE id = $1
```

#### **Check Race Exists:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM races WHERE id = $1
```

#### **Check Duplicate Application:**

```sql
SELECT id FROM applications WHERE user_id = $1 AND race_id = $2
```

#### **Check Application Ownership:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM applications WHERE id = $1 AND user_id = $2
```

## üîê Security Features

### **Authorization:**

- ‚úÖ Role-based access control (Applicant only)
- ‚úÖ JWT token validation
- ‚úÖ User context in all operations
- ‚úÖ Ownership validation (users can only delete their own applications)

### **Validation:**

- ‚úÖ Input validation with Joi schemas
- ‚úÖ Business rule validation (race existence, duplicate prevention)
- ‚úÖ SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
- ‚úÖ UUID format validation

### **Error Handling:**

- ‚úÖ Graceful error handling
- ‚úÖ Proper HTTP status codes
- ‚úÖ Detailed error messages
- ‚úÖ Event publishing failure handling

## üìù Logging

### **Log Examples:**

```
15:25:02 [info]: Application created successfully {"applicationId":"d952e6e4-800a-4b56-9770-631bf48d53c9","userId":"90de7bc0-88bd-46de-bfd5-d630b2065f1d","raceId":"8836353a-0100-4e86-b74a-d7ca19a88866","firstName":"Test","lastName":"User"}

15:25:02 [info]: Application deleted successfully {"applicationId":"d952e6e4-800a-4b56-9770-631bf48d53c9","userId":"90de7bc0-88bd-46de-bfd5-d630b2065f1d","raceId":"8836353a-0100-4e86-b74a-d7ca19a88866","firstName":"Test","lastName":"User"}
```

## üéØ Business Logic

### **Application Creation Rules:**

1. ‚úÖ Only Applicant role can create applications
2. ‚úÖ Race must exist before creating application
3. ‚úÖ User cannot apply for same race twice
4. ‚úÖ All required fields must be provided
5. ‚úÖ Club field is optional

### **Application Deletion Rules:**

1. ‚úÖ Only Applicant role can delete applications
2. ‚úÖ Users can only delete their own applications
3. ‚úÖ Application must exist before deletion
4. ‚úÖ No restrictions on deletion (unlike races with applications)

## üéØ Next Steps

### **What's Next:**

1. ‚úÖ Race API endpoints - **COMPLETED**
2. ‚úÖ Application API endpoints - **COMPLETED**
3. ‚ùå Query Service implementation - **NEXT**
4. ‚ùå Client App (Next.js)

### **Query Service to Implement:**

- Event consumption from RabbitMQ
- Read-only API endpoints for races and applications
- Data synchronization with Command Service

---

**Note**: This implementation follows CQRS pattern where Command Service handles write operations and publishes events for Query Service to consume.
